As the amount of publications grows on any given field, automatic tools for this sort of analysis are becoming increasingly important prior to starting research on new fields.\r\n\r\nSNA is an interesting way for researchers to map large datasets and get insights from new angles. The steps for downloading data from Web of Knowledge and using our tools to process it are detailed below. The set of tools which are required to perform the analyses are free and need a minimum amount of installation. Furthermore, we will soon make a web-based analysis server HAMMER available so that you can process the data without needing to do any installation or manual processing steps.\r\n\r\nThe project files are available as open source here in our Github repository.\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n----\r\n\r\nThese scripts can be used to complete an exploratory literature review\r\nusing data downloaded from Web of Knowledge.\r\n\r\n1. Go to Web of Knowledge website and select Web of Science Core Collection \r\nfrom the dropdown menu. \r\n2. Search for literature.\r\n3. Download data. Select Save to Other File Formats from the dropdown menu, \r\nenter the range of records (max 500 records for one download), and download \r\nFull Record and Cited References. File format should be Tab-delimited (Win) or\r\nTab-delimited (Mac). If you need more than 500 records, repeat the download.\r\n4. Put the downloaded files into the input folder.\r\n5. Open exploration.Rmd with RStudio and press Knit HTML -button. \r\nThe script will combine the downloaded data into a single file, process it and\r\ncreate visualizations. The results are saved as a HTML-file exploration.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe script also creates node and edge tables for author and citation \r\nnetworks that can be loaded to Gephi for further exploration.  \r\n\r\nSee further instructions for data gathering from Web of Knowledge and manual processing steps at https://sites.google.com/site/bibliometricdatavisualization/home\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
